## Exploring SpaceX Falcon 9 landings. In determining the success of the landings, we will be able to determine the cost of the launches. SpaceX's website states Falcon 9 rocket launches cost around 62 million dollars, while other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each. Much of the savings is because Space X is able to reuse the first stage. Therefore, by deteriming if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. Furthermore, by the end, we will create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land given the data from the preceding labs.
